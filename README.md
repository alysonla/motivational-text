#Motivational Text 

##@alysonla version

What it is...

Similar to Brent Beer, I think it would be awesome to a motiviational text every couple days or so telling me how awesome I am, in case I forget. 

Also I've been wanted to try to hack on a thing using Twilio. 

TODO:

* Figure out to run the current project 
* Hack on it to customize messages
* Link the project page

Current problem: 

* Getting an error when starting the rails server: 
`An error occurred while installing SystemTimer (1.2.3), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install SystemTimer -v '1.2.3'` succeeds before bundling.`

A hack from: 

#Motivational Text!

##Texting? Why
This app was starting in lieu of me needing to receive a motivational
text every morning by [Jarod Luebbert](http://github.com/jarodl) wishing me a great
day. So, hell...Why not give that to everyone!

##What is this?
This is my first jump into [MonogoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and 
[delayed jobs](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) more specifically
[delayed job for mongoid](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job_mongoid)
and [Twilio](http://twilio.com) as a web app. Hopefully all goes well.

##Overview
After a user desides to sign up. They can edit days of the week they want 
to receive a text message on, and more specifically what time of the day.
And that's it! (So far).
