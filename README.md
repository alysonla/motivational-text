#Motivational Text!

##Texting? Why
This app was starting in lieu of me needing to receive a motivational
text every morning by [Jarod Luebbert](http://github.com/jarodl) wishing me a great
day. So, hell...Why not give that to everyone!

##What is this?
This is my first jump into [MonogoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and 
[delayed jobs](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) more specifically
[delayed job for mongoid](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job_mongoid)
and [Twilio](http://twilio.com) as a web app. Hopefully all goes well.

##Overview
After a user desides to sign up. They can edit days of the week they want 
to receive a text message on, and more specifically what time of the day.
And that's it! (So far).
