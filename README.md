#Motivational Text!

##Texting? Why
This app was starting in lieu of me receiving a motivational text one 
morning by [Jarod Luebbert](http://github.com/jarodl) wishing me a great
day. So, hell...Why not all of us?

##What is this?
This is my first jump into [MonogoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and a 
background job worker ([Resque maybe?](https://github.com/defunkt/resque))
and [Twilio](http://twilio.com) as a web app. Hopefully all goes well.

##Overview
After a user desides to sign up. They can edit days of the week they want 
to receive a text message on, and more specifically what time of the day.
And that's it! (So far).
